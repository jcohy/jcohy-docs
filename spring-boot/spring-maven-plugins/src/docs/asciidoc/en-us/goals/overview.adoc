| Goal | Description

| <<goals-build-image,spring-boot:build-image>>
| `BuildImageMojo implementation` that forks the lifecycle to make sure that `package` ran. This goal is suitable for command-line invocation. If you need to configure a mojo `execution` in your build, use `BuildImageNoForkMojo` instead.

| <<goals-build-image-no-fork,spring-boot:build-image-no-fork>>
| `BuildImageMojo implementation` that does not fork the lifecycle to make sure that `package` ran. This goal should be used when configuring a mojo `execution` in your build. To invoke the goal on the command-line, use `BuildImageForkMojo` instead.

| <<goals-build-info,spring-boot:build-info>>
| Generate a `build-info.properties` file based on the content of the current `MavenProject`.

| <<goals-help,spring-boot:help>>
| Display help information on spring-boot-maven-plugin.  Call `mvn spring-boot:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name>` to display parameter details.

| <<goals-process-aot,spring-boot:process-aot>>
| Invoke the AOT engine on the application.

| <<goals-process-test-aot,spring-boot:process-test-aot>>
| Invoke the AOT engine on tests.

| <<goals-repackage,spring-boot:repackage>>
| Repackage existing JAR and WAR archives so that they can be executed from the command line using `java -jar`. With `layout=NONE` can also be used simply to package a JAR with nested dependencies (and no main class, so not executable).

| <<goals-run,spring-boot:run>>
| Run an application in place.

| <<goals-start,spring-boot:start>>
| Start a spring application. Contrary to the `run` goal, this does not block and allows other goals to operate on the application. This goal is typically used in integration test scenario where the application is started before a test suite and stopped after.

| <<goals-stop,spring-boot:stop>>
| Stop an application that has been started by the "start" goal. Typically invoked once a test suite has completed.
