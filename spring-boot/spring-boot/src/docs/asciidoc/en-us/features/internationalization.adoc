== Internationalization
Spring Boot supports localized messages so that your application can cater to users of different language preferences.
By default, Spring Boot looks for the presence of a `messages` resource bundle at the root of the classpath.

NOTE: The auto-configuration applies when the default properties file for the configured resource bundle is available (`messages.properties` by default).
If your resource bundle contains only language-specific properties files, you are required to add the default.
If no properties file is found that matches any of the configured base names, there will be no auto-configured `MessageSource`.

The basename of the resource bundle as well as several other attributes can be configured using the `spring.messages` namespace, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  messages:
	    basename: "messages,config.i18n.messages"
	    fallback-to-system-locale: false
----

TIP: `spring.messages.basename` supports comma-separated list of locations, either a package qualifier or a resource resolved from the classpath root.

See {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/context/MessageSourceProperties.java[`MessageSourceProperties`] for more supported options.
