[[web.spring-session]]
== Spring Session
Spring Boot provides {spring-session}[Spring Session] auto-configuration for a wide range of data stores.
When building a servlet web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

* JDBC
* Redis
* Hazelcast
* MongoDB

Additionally, {spring-boot-for-apache-geode}[Spring Boot for Apache Geode] provides {spring-boot-for-apache-geode-docs}#geode-session[auto-configuration for using Apache Geode as a session store].

The servlet auto-configuration replaces the need to use `@Enable*HttpSession`.

When building a reactive web application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

* Redis
* MongoDB

The reactive auto-configuration replaces the need to use `@Enable*WebSession`.

If a single Spring Session module is present on the classpath, Spring Boot uses that store implementation automatically.
If you have more than one implementation, you must choose the {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/session/StoreType.java[`StoreType`] that you wish to use to store the sessions.
For instance, to use JDBC as the back-end store, you can configure your application as follows:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  session:
	    store-type: "jdbc"
----

TIP: You can disable Spring Session by setting the `store-type` to `none`.

Each store has specific additional settings.
For instance, it is possible to customize the name of the table for the JDBC store, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  session:
	    jdbc:
	      table-name: "SESSIONS"
----

For setting the timeout of the session you can use the configprop:spring.session.timeout[] property.
If that property is not set with a servlet web application, the auto-configuration falls back to the value of configprop:server.servlet.session.timeout[].


You can take control over Spring Session's configuration using `@Enable*HttpSession` (servlet) or `@Enable*WebSession` (reactive).
This will cause the auto-configuration to back off.
Spring Session can then be configured using the annotation's attributes rather than the previously described configuration properties.
