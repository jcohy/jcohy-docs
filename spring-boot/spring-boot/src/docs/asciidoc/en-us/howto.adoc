= "`How-to`" Guides
include::attributes.adoc[]



This section provides answers to some common '`how do I do that...`' questions that often arise when using Spring Boot.
Its coverage is not exhaustive, but it does cover quite a lot.

If you have a specific problem that we do not cover here, you might want to check https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot[stackoverflow.com] to see if someone has already provided an answer.
This is also a great place to ask new questions (please use the `spring-boot` tag).

We are also more than happy to extend this section.
If you want to add a '`how-to`', send us a {spring-boot-code}[pull request].
