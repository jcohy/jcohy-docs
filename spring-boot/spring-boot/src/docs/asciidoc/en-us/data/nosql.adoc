[[data.nosql]]
== Working with NoSQL Technologies
Spring Data provides additional projects that help you access a variety of NoSQL technologies, including:

* {spring-data-mongodb}[MongoDB]
* {spring-data-neo4j}[Neo4J]
* {spring-data-elasticsearch}[Elasticsearch]
* {spring-data-redis}[Redis]
* {spring-data-gemfire}[GemFire] or {spring-data-geode}[Geode]
* {spring-data-cassandra}[Cassandra]
* {spring-data-couchbase}[Couchbase]
* {spring-data-ldap}[LDAP]

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, Solr, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Couchbase, LDAP and InfluxDB.
Additionally, {spring-boot-for-apache-geode}[Spring Boot for Apache Geode] provides {spring-boot-for-apache-geode-docs}#geode-repositories[auto-configuration for Apache Geode].
You can make use of the other projects, but you must configure them yourself.
See the appropriate reference documentation at {spring-data}.



[[data.nosql.redis]]
=== Redis
https://redis.io/[Redis] is a cache, message broker, and richly-featured key-value store.
Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/[Lettuce] and https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/[Jedis] client libraries and the abstractions on top of them provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis[Spring Data Redis].

There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` "`Starter`" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.
By default, it uses https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/[Lettuce].
That starter handles both traditional and reactive applications.

TIP: We also provide a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive` "`Starter`" for consistency with the other stores with reactive support.



[[data.nosql.redis.connecting]]
==== Connecting to Redis
You can inject an auto-configured `RedisConnectionFactory`, `StringRedisTemplate`, or vanilla `RedisTemplate` instance as you would any other Spring Bean.
By default, the instance tries to connect to a Redis server at `localhost:6379`.
The following listing shows an example of such a bean:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/redis/connecting/MyBean.java[]
----

TIP: You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `LettuceClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations.
`ClientResources` can also be customized using `ClientResourcesBuilderCustomizer`.
If you use Jedis, `JedisClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer` is also available.
Alternatively, you can register a bean of type `RedisStandaloneConfiguration`, `RedisSentinelConfiguration`, or `RedisClusterConfiguration` to take full control over the configuration.

If you add your own `@Bean` of any of the auto-configured types, it replaces the default (except in the case of `RedisTemplate`, when the exclusion is based on the bean name, `redisTemplate`, not its type).

By default, a pooled connection factory is auto-configured if `commons-pool2` is on the classpath.



[[data.nosql.mongodb]]
=== MongoDB
https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] is an open-source NoSQL document database that uses a JSON-like schema instead of traditional table-based relational data.
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with MongoDB, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` and `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb-reactive` "`Starters`".



[[data.nosql.mongodb.connecting]]
==== Connecting to a MongoDB Database
To access MongoDB databases, you can inject an auto-configured `org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory`.
By default, the instance tries to connect to a MongoDB server at `mongodb://localhost/test`.
The following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB database:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/mongodb/connecting/MyBean.java[]
----

If you have defined your own `MongoClient`, it will be used to auto-configure a suitable `MongoDatabaseFactory`.

The auto-configured `MongoClient` is created using a `MongoClientSettings` bean.
If you have defined your own `MongoClientSettings`, it will be used without modification and the `spring.data.mongodb` properties will be ignored.
Otherwise a `MongoClientSettings` will be auto-configured and will have the `spring.data.mongodb` properties applied to it.
In either case, you can declare one or more `MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer` beans to fine-tune the `MongoClientSettings` configuration.
Each will be called in order with the `MongoClientSettings.Builder` that is used to build the `MongoClientSettings`.

You can set the configprop:spring.data.mongodb.uri[] property to change the URL and configure additional settings such as the _replica set_, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  data:
	    mongodb:
	      uri: "mongodb://user:secret@mongo1.example.com:12345,mongo2.example.com:23456/test"
----

Alternatively, you can specify connection details using discrete properties.
For example, you might declare the following settings in your `application.properties`:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  data:
	    mongodb:
	      host: "mongoserver.example.com"
	      port: 27017
	      database: "test"
	      username: "user"
	      password: "secret"
----

TIP: If `spring.data.mongodb.port` is not specified, the default of `27017` is used.
You could delete this line from the example shown earlier.

TIP: If you do not use Spring Data MongoDB, you can inject a `MongoClient` bean instead of using `MongoDatabaseFactory`.
If you want to take complete control of establishing the MongoDB connection, you can also declare your own `MongoDatabaseFactory` or `MongoClient` bean.

NOTE: If you are using the reactive driver, Netty is required for SSL.
The auto-configuration configures this factory automatically if Netty is available and the factory to use has not been customized already.



[[data.nosql.mongodb.template]]
==== MongoTemplate
{spring-data-mongodb}[Spring Data MongoDB] provides a {spring-data-mongodb-api}/core/MongoTemplate.html[`MongoTemplate`] class that is very similar in its design to Spring's `JdbcTemplate`.
As with `JdbcTemplate`, Spring Boot auto-configures a bean for you to inject the template, as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/mongodb/template/MyBean.java[]
----

See the {spring-data-mongodb-api}/core/MongoOperations.html[`MongoOperations` Javadoc] for complete details.



[[data.nosql.mongodb.repositories]]
==== Spring Data MongoDB Repositories
Spring Data includes repository support for MongoDB.
As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed automatically, based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB share the same common infrastructure.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now a MongoDB data class rather than a JPA `@Entity`, it works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/mongodb/repositories/CityRepository.java[]
----

TIP: You can customize document scanning locations by using the `@EntityScan` annotation.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data MongoDB, including its rich object mapping technologies, see its {spring-data-mongodb}[reference documentation].



[[data.nosql.mongodb.embedded]]
==== Embedded Mongo
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo[Embedded Mongo].
To use it in your Spring Boot application, add a dependency on `de.flapdoodle.embed:de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo` and set the configprop:spring.mongodb.embedded.version[] property to match the version of MongoDB that your application will use in production.

NOTE: The default download configuration allows access to most of the versions listed in {embedded-mongo-code}/src/main/java/de/flapdoodle/embed/mongo/distribution/Version.java[Embedded Mongo's `Version` class] as well as some others.
Configuring an inaccessible version will result in an error when attempting to download the server.
Such an error can be corrected by defining an appropriately configured `DownloadConfigBuilderCustomizer` bean.

The port that Mongo listens on can be configured by setting the configprop:spring.data.mongodb.port[] property.
To use a randomly allocated free port, use a value of 0.
The `MongoClient` created by `MongoAutoConfiguration` is automatically configured to use the randomly allocated port.

NOTE: If you do not configure a custom port, the embedded support uses a random port (rather than 27017) by default.

If you have SLF4J on the classpath, the output produced by Mongo is automatically routed to a logger named `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.embedded.EmbeddedMongo`.

You can declare your own `IMongodConfig` and `IRuntimeConfig` beans to take control of the Mongo instance's configuration and logging routing.
The download configuration can be customized by declaring a `DownloadConfigBuilderCustomizer` bean.


[[data.nosql.neo4j]]
=== Neo4j
https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] is an open-source NoSQL graph database that uses a rich data model of nodes connected by first class relationships, which is better suited for connected big data than traditional RDBMS approaches.
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Neo4j, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` "`Starter`".



[[data.nosql.neo4j.connecting]]
==== Connecting to a Neo4j Database
To access a Neo4j server, you can inject an auto-configured `org.neo4j.driver.Driver`.
By default, the instance tries to connect to a Neo4j server at `localhost:7687` using the Bolt protocol.
The following example shows how to inject a Neo4j `Driver` that gives you access, amongst other things, to a `Session`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/neo4j/connecting/MyBean.java[]
----

You can configure various aspects of the driver using `spring.neo4j.*` properties.
The following example shows how to configure the uri and credentials to use:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  neo4j:
	    uri: "bolt://my-server:7687"
	    authentication:
	      username: "neo4j"
	      password: "secret"
----

The auto-configured `Driver` is created using `ConfigBuilder`.
To fine-tune its configuration, declare one or more `ConfigBuilderCustomizer` beans.
Each will be called in order with the `ConfigBuilder` that is used to build the `Driver`.



[[data.nosql.neo4j.repositories]]
==== Spring Data Neo4j Repositories
Spring Data includes repository support for Neo4j.
For complete details of Spring Data Neo4j, see the {spring-data-neo4j-docs}[reference documentation].

Spring Data Neo4j shares the common infrastructure with Spring Data JPA as many other Spring Data modules do.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and define `City` as Spring Data Neo4j `@Node` rather than JPA `@Entity` and the repository abstraction works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/neo4j/repositories/CityRepository.java[]
----

The `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` "`Starter`" enables the repository support as well as transaction management.
Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Neo4j repositories, using the `Neo4jTemplate` or `ReactiveNeo4jTemplate` beans.
When Project Reactor is available on the classpath, the reactive style is also auto-configured.

You can customize the locations to look for repositories and entities by using `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` and `@EntityScan` respectively on a `@Configuration`-bean.

[NOTE]
====
In an application using the reactive style, a `ReactiveTransactionManager` is not auto-configured.
To enable transaction management, the following bean must be defined in your configuration:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/neo4j/repositories/MyNeo4jConfiguration.java[]
----
====



[[data.nosql.solr]]
=== Solr
https://lucene.apache.org/solr/[Apache Solr] is a search engine.
Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the Solr 5 client library.



[[data.nosql.solr.connecting]]
==== Connecting to Solr
You can inject an auto-configured `SolrClient` instance as you would any other Spring bean.
By default, the instance tries to connect to a server at `http://localhost:8983/solr`.
The following example shows how to inject a Solr bean:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/solr/connecting/MyBean.java[]
----

If you add your own `@Bean` of type `SolrClient`, it replaces the default.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] is an open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for Elasticsearch clients.

Spring Boot supports several clients:

* The official Java "Low Level" and "High Level" REST clients
* The `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` provided by Spring Data Elasticsearch

Spring Boot provides a dedicated "`Starter`", `spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch`.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest]]
==== Connecting to Elasticsearch using REST clients
Elasticsearch ships https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html[two different REST clients] that you can use to query a cluster: the "Low Level" client and the "High Level" client.
Spring Boot provides support for the "High Level" client, which ships with `org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client`.
Additionally, Spring Boot provides support for a reactive client, based on Spring Framework's `WebClient`, that ships with `org.springframework.data:spring-data-elasticsearch`.
By default, the clients will target `http://localhost:9200`.
You can use `spring.elasticsearch.*` properties to further tune how the clients are configured, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  elasticsearch:
	    uris: "https://search.example.com:9200"
	    socket-timeout: "10s"
	    username: "user"
	    password: "secret"
----

[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.restclient]]
===== Connecting to Elasticsearch using RestHighLevelClient
If you have `elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client` on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a `RestHighLevelClient` bean.
In addition to the properties described previously, to fine-tune the `RestHighLevelClient`, you can register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `RestClientBuilderCustomizer` for more advanced customizations.
To take full control over its registration, define a `RestClientBuilder` bean.

TIP: If your application needs access to a "Low Level" `RestClient`, you can get it by calling `client.getLowLevelClient()` on the auto-configured `RestHighLevelClient`.

Additionally, if `elasticsearch-rest-client-sniffer` is on the classpath, a `Sniffer` is auto-configured to automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster and set them on the `RestHighLevelClient` bean.
You can further tune how `Sniffer` is configured, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  elasticsearch:
	    restclient:
	      sniffer:
	        interval: "10m"
	        delay-after-failure: "30s"
----



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.webclient]]
===== Connecting to Elasticsearch using ReactiveElasticsearchClient
{spring-data-elasticsearch}[Spring Data Elasticsearch] ships `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` for querying Elasticsearch instances in a reactive fashion.
It is built on top of WebFlux's `WebClient`, so both `spring-boot-starter-elasticsearch` and `spring-boot-starter-webflux` dependencies are useful to enable this support.

By default, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a `ReactiveElasticsearchClient`.
In addition to the properties described previously, the `spring.elasticsearch.webclient.*` properties can be used to configure reactive-specific settings, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  elasticsearch:
	    webclient:
	      max-in-memory-size: "1MB"
----

If the `spring.elasticsearch.*` and `spring.elasticsearch.webclient.*` configuration properties are not enough and you'd like to fully control the client configuration, you can register a custom `ClientConfiguration` bean.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-spring-data]]
==== Connecting to Elasticsearch by Using Spring Data
To connect to Elasticsearch, a `RestHighLevelClient` bean must be defined,
auto-configured by Spring Boot or manually provided by the application (see previous sections).
With this configuration in place, an
`ElasticsearchRestTemplate` can be injected like any other Spring bean,
as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/elasticsearch/connectingusingspringdata/MyBean.java[]
----

In the presence of `spring-data-elasticsearch` and the required dependencies for using a `WebClient` (typically `spring-boot-starter-webflux`), Spring Boot can also auto-configure a <<features#data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.webclient,ReactiveElasticsearchClient>> and a `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` as beans.
They are the reactive equivalent of the other REST clients.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.repositories]]
==== Spring Data Elasticsearch Repositories
Spring Data includes repository support for Elasticsearch.
As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed for you automatically based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Elasticsearch share the same common infrastructure.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now an Elasticsearch `@Document` class rather than a JPA `@Entity`, it works in the same way.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data Elasticsearch, see the {spring-data-elasticsearch-docs}[reference documentation].

Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Elasticsearch repositories, using the `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` beans.
Most likely those beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot given the required dependencies are present.

If you wish to use your own template for backing the Elasticsearch repositories, you can add your own `ElasticsearchRestTemplate` or `ElasticsearchOperations` `@Bean`, as long as it is named `"elasticsearchTemplate"`.
Same applies to `ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate` and `ReactiveElasticsearchOperations`, with the bean name `"reactiveElasticsearchTemplate"`.

You can choose to disable the repositories support with the following property:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
    spring:
      data:
        elasticsearch:
          repositories:
            enabled: false
----



[[data.nosql.cassandra]]
=== Cassandra
https://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] is an open source, distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Cassandra and the abstractions on top of it provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra[Spring Data Cassandra].
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra` "`Starter`" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.cassandra.connecting]]
==== Connecting to Cassandra
You can inject an auto-configured `CassandraTemplate` or a Cassandra `CqlSession` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean.
The `spring.data.cassandra.*` properties can be used to customize the connection.
Generally, you provide `keyspace-name` and `contact-points` as well the local datacenter name, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  data:
	    cassandra:
	      keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
	      contact-points: "cassandrahost1:9042,cassandrahost2:9042"
	      local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
----

If the port is the same for all your contact points you can use a shortcut and only specify the host names, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  data:
	    cassandra:
	      keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
	      contact-points: "cassandrahost1,cassandrahost2"
	      local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
----

TIP: Those two examples are identical as the port default to `9042`.
If you need to configure the port, use `spring.data.cassandra.port`.

[NOTE]
====
The Cassandra driver has its own configuration infrastructure that loads an `application.conf` at the root of the classpath.

Spring Boot does not look for such a file by default but can load one using `spring.data.cassandra.config`.
If a property is both present in `+spring.data.cassandra.*+` and the configuration file, the value in `+spring.data.cassandra.*+` takes precedence.

For more advanced driver customizations, you can register an arbitrary number of beans that implement `DriverConfigLoaderBuilderCustomizer`.
The `CqlSession` can be customized with a bean of type `CqlSessionBuilderCustomizer`.
====

NOTE: If you use `CqlSessionBuilder` to create multiple `CqlSession` beans, keep in mind the builder is mutable so make sure to inject a fresh copy for each session.

The following code listing shows how to inject a Cassandra bean:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/cassandra/connecting/MyBean.java[]
----

If you add your own `@Bean` of type `CassandraTemplate`, it replaces the default.



[[data.nosql.cassandra.repositories]]
==== Spring Data Cassandra Repositories
Spring Data includes basic repository support for Cassandra.
Currently, this is more limited than the JPA repositories discussed earlier and needs to annotate finder methods with `@Query`.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data Cassandra, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/[reference documentation].



[[data.nosql.couchbase]]
=== Couchbase
https://www.couchbase.com/[Couchbase] is an open-source, distributed, multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Couchbase and the abstractions on top of it provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-couchbase[Spring Data Couchbase].
There are `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase` and `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase-reactive` "`Starters`" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.couchbase.connecting]]
==== Connecting to Couchbase
You can get a `Cluster` by adding the Couchbase SDK and some configuration.
The `spring.couchbase.*` properties can be used to customize the connection.
Generally, you provide the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0011-connection-string.md[connection string], username, and password, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  couchbase:
	    connection-string: "couchbase://192.168.1.123"
	    username: "user"
	    password: "secret"
----

It is also possible to customize some of the `ClusterEnvironment` settings.
For instance, the following configuration changes the timeout to use to open a new `Bucket` and enables SSL support:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  couchbase:
	    env:
	      timeouts:
	        connect: "3s"
	      ssl:
	        key-store: "/location/of/keystore.jks"
	        key-store-password: "secret"
----

TIP: Check the `spring.couchbase.env.*` properties for more details.
To take more control, one or more `ClusterEnvironmentBuilderCustomizer` beans can be used.



[[data.nosql.couchbase.repositories]]
==== Spring Data Couchbase Repositories
Spring Data includes repository support for Couchbase.
For complete details of Spring Data Couchbase, see the {spring-data-couchbase-docs}[reference documentation].

You can inject an auto-configured `CouchbaseTemplate` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, provided a `CouchbaseClientFactory` bean is available.
This happens when a `Cluster` is available, as described above, and a bucket name has been specified:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  data:
	    couchbase:
	      bucket-name: "my-bucket"
----

The following examples shows how to inject a `CouchbaseTemplate` bean:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/couchbase/repositories/MyBean.java[]
----

There are a few beans that you can define in your own configuration to override those provided by the auto-configuration:

* A `CouchbaseMappingContext` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseMappingContext`.
* A `CustomConversions` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseCustomConversions`.
* A `CouchbaseTemplate` `@Bean` with a name of `couchbaseTemplate`.

To avoid hard-coding those names in your own config, you can reuse `BeanNames` provided by Spring Data Couchbase.
For instance, you can customize the converters to use, as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/couchbase/repositories/MyCouchbaseConfiguration.java[]
----



[[data.nosql.ldap]]
=== LDAP
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol[LDAP] (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for any compliant LDAP server as well as support for the embedded in-memory LDAP server from https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/[UnboundID].

LDAP abstractions are provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-ldap[Spring Data LDAP].
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` "`Starter`" for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.ldap.connecting]]
==== Connecting to an LDAP Server
To connect to an LDAP server, make sure you declare a dependency on the `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` "`Starter`" or `spring-ldap-core` and then declare the URLs of your server in your application.properties, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  ldap:
	    urls: "ldap://myserver:1235"
	    username: "admin"
	    password: "secret"
----

If you need to customize connection settings, you can use the `spring.ldap.base` and `spring.ldap.base-environment` properties.

An `LdapContextSource` is auto-configured based on these settings.
If a `DirContextAuthenticationStrategy` bean is available, it is associated to the auto-configured `LdapContextSource`.
If you need to customize it, for instance to use a `PooledContextSource`, you can still inject the auto-configured `LdapContextSource`.
Make sure to flag your customized `ContextSource` as `@Primary` so that the auto-configured `LdapTemplate` uses it.



[[data.nosql.ldap.repositories]]
==== Spring Data LDAP Repositories
Spring Data includes repository support for LDAP.
For complete details of Spring Data LDAP, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/ldap/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/[reference documentation].

You can also inject an auto-configured `LdapTemplate` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, as shown in the following example:


[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/data/nosql/ldap/repositories/MyBean.java[]
----



[[data.nosql.ldap.embedded]]
==== Embedded In-memory LDAP Server
For testing purposes, Spring Boot supports auto-configuration of an in-memory LDAP server from https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/[UnboundID].
To configure the server, add a dependency to `com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk` and declare a configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn[] property, as follows:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  ldap:
	    embedded:
	      base-dn: "dc=spring,dc=io"
----

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to define multiple base-dn values, however, since distinguished names usually contain commas, they must be defined using the correct notation.

In yaml files, you can use the yaml list notation. In properties files, you must include the index as part of the property name:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn:
	  - "dc=spring,dc=io"
	  - "dc=pivotal,dc=io"
----
====

By default, the server starts on a random port and triggers the regular LDAP support.
There is no need to specify a configprop:spring.ldap.urls[] property.

If there is a `schema.ldif` file on your classpath, it is used to initialize the server.
If you want to load the initialization script from a different resource, you can also use the configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.ldif[] property.

By default, a standard schema is used to validate `LDIF` files.
You can turn off validation altogether by setting the configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.validation.enabled[] property.
If you have custom attributes, you can use configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.validation.schema[] to define your custom attribute types or object classes.

=== InfluxDB
https://www.influxdata.com/[InfluxDB] is an open-source time series database optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet-of-Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

==== Connecting to InfluxDB
Spring Boot auto-configures an `InfluxDB` instance, provided the `influxdb-java` client is on the classpath and the URL of the database is set, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  influx:
	    url: "https://172.0.0.1:8086"
----

If the connection to InfluxDB requires a user and password, you can set the `spring.influx.user` and `spring.influx.password` properties accordingly.

InfluxDB relies on OkHttp.
If you need to tune the http client `InfluxDB` uses behind the scenes, you can register an `InfluxDbOkHttpClientBuilderProvider` bean.

If you need more control over the configuration, consider registering an `InfluxDbCustomizer` bean.
