[[actuator.micrometer-tracing]]
== Tracing
Spring Boot Actuator provides dependency management and auto-configuration for https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing], a facade for popular tracer libraries.

TIP: To learn more about Micrometer Tracing capabilities, see its https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[reference documentation].



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracers]]
=== Supported Tracers
Spring Boot ships auto-configuration for the following tracers:

* https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] with https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin] or https://docs.wavefront.com/[Wavefront]
* https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[OpenZipkin Brave] with https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin] or https://docs.wavefront.com/[Wavefront]



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.getting-started]]
=== Getting Started
We need an example application that we can use to getting started with tracing.
For our purposes, the simple "`Hello World!`" web application that's covered in the "`<<getting-started#getting-started.first-application>>`" section will suffice.
We're going to use the OpenTelemetry tracer with Zipkin as trace backend.

To recap, our main application code looks like this:

include::code:MyApplication[]

NOTE: There's an added logger statement in the `home()` method, which will be important later.

Now we have to add the following dependencies:

* `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator`
* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` - which is needed to bridge the Micrometer Observation API to OpenTelemetry.
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin` - which is needed to report https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing#_glossary[traces] to Zipkin.

Add the following application properties:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	management.tracing.sampling.probability: 1.0
----

By default, Spring Boot samples only 10% of requests to prevent overwhelming the trace backend.
This property switches it to 100% so that every request is sent to the trace backend.

To collect and visualize the traces, we need a running trace backend.
We use Zipkin as our trace backend here.
The https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart[Zipkin Quickstart guide] provides instructions how to start Zipkin locally.

After Zipkin is running, you can start your application.

If you open a web browser to `http://localhost:8080`, you should see the following output:

[indent=0]
----
	Hello World!
----

Behind the scenes, an observation has been created for the HTTP request, which in turn gets bridged to OpenTelemetry, which reports a new trace to Zipkin.

Now open the Zipkin UI at `http://localhost:9411` and press the "Run Query" button to list all collected traces.
You should see one trace.
Press the "Show" button to see the details of that trace.

TIP: You can include the current trace and span id in the logs by setting the `logging.pattern.level` property to `%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}]`



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracer-implementations]]
=== Tracer Implementations
As Micrometer Tracer supports multiple tracer implementations, there are multiple dependency combinations possible with Spring Boot.

All tracer implementations need the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency.



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracer-implementations.otel-zipkin]]
==== OpenTelemetry With Zipkin

* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` - which is needed to bride the Micrometer Observation API to OpenTelemetry.
* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin` - which is needed to report traces to Zipkin.



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracer-implementations.otel-wavefront]]
==== OpenTelemetry With Wavefront

* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` - which is needed to bride the Micrometer Observation API to OpenTelemetry.
* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-reporter-wavefront` - which is needed to report traces to Wavefront.



[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracer-implementations.brave-zipkin]]
==== OpenZipkin Brave With Zipkin

* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave` - which is needed to bridge the Micrometer Observation API to Brave.
* `io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave` - which is needed to report traces to Zipkin.

NOTE: If your project doesn't use Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux, the `io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-urlconnection` dependency is needed, too.

[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.tracer-implementations.brave-wavefront]]
==== OpenZipkin Brave With Wavefront

* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave` - which is needed to bridge the Micrometer Observation API to Brave.
* `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-reporter-wavefront` - which is needed to report traces to Wavefront.

[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.micrometer-observation]]
=== Integration with Micrometer Observation

A `TracingAwareMeterObservationHandler` is automatically registered on the `ObservationRegistry`, which creates spans for every completed observation.

[[actuator.micrometer-tracing.creating-spans]]
=== Creating Custom Spans
You can create your own spans by starting an observation.
For this, inject `ObservationRegistry` into your component:

include::code:CustomObservation[]

This will create an observation named "some-operation" with the tag "some-tag=some-value".

TIP: If you want to create a span without creating a metric, you need to use the https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing#_using_micrometer_tracing_directly[lower-level `Tracer` API] from Micrometer.
