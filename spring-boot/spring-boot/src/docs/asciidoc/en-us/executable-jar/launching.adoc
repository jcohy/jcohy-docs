== Launching Executable Jars
The `org.springframework.boot.loader.Launcher` class is a special bootstrap class that is used as an executable jar's main entry point.
It is the actual `Main-Class` in your jar file, and it is used to setup an appropriate `URLClassLoader` and ultimately call your `main()` method.

There are three launcher subclasses (`JarLauncher`, `WarLauncher`, and `PropertiesLauncher`).
Their purpose is to load resources (`.class` files and so on) from nested jar files or war files in directories (as opposed to those explicitly on the classpath).
In the case of `JarLauncher` and `WarLauncher`, the nested paths are fixed.
`JarLauncher` looks in `BOOT-INF/lib/`, and `WarLauncher` looks in `WEB-INF/lib/` and `WEB-INF/lib-provided/`.
You can add extra jars in those locations if you want more.
The `PropertiesLauncher` looks in `BOOT-INF/lib/` in your application archive by default.
You can add additional locations by setting an environment variable called `LOADER_PATH` or `loader.path` in `loader.properties` (which is a comma-separated list of directories, archives, or directories within archives).



[[appendix.executable-jar.launching.manifest]]
=== Launcher Manifest
You need to specify an appropriate `Launcher` as the `Main-Class` attribute of `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.
The actual class that you want to launch (that is, the class that contains a `main` method) should be specified in the `Start-Class` attribute.

The following example shows a typical `MANIFEST.MF` for an executable jar file:

[indent=0]
----
	Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
	Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
----

For a war file, it would be as follows:

[indent=0]
----
	Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.WarLauncher
	Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
----

NOTE: You need not specify `Class-Path` entries in your manifest file.
The classpath is deduced from the nested jars.
