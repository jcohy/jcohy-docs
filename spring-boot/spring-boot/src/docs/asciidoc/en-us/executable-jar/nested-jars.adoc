== Nested JARs
Java does not provide any standard way to load nested jar files (that is, jar files that are themselves contained within a jar).
This can be problematic if you need to distribute a self-contained application that can be run from the command line without unpacking.

To solve this problem, many developers use "`shaded`" jars.
A shaded jar packages all classes, from all jars, into a single "`uber jar`".
The problem with shaded jars is that it becomes hard to see which libraries are actually in your application.
It can also be problematic if the same filename is used (but with different content) in multiple jars.
Spring Boot takes a different approach and lets you actually nest jars directly.



[[appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.jar-structure]]
=== The Executable Jar File Structure
Spring Boot Loader-compatible jar files should be structured in the following way:

[indent=0]
----
	example.jar
	 |
	 +-META-INF
	 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
	 +-org
	 |  +-springframework
	 |     +-boot
	 |        +-loader
	 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
	 +-BOOT-INF
	    +-classes
	    |  +-mycompany
	    |     +-project
	    |        +-YourClasses.class
	    +-lib
	       +-dependency1.jar
	       +-dependency2.jar
----

Application classes should be placed in a nested `BOOT-INF/classes` directory.
Dependencies should be placed in a nested `BOOT-INF/lib` directory.



[[appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.war-structure]]
=== The Executable War File Structure
Spring Boot Loader-compatible war files should be structured in the following way:

[indent=0]
----
	example.war
	 |
	 +-META-INF
	 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
	 +-org
	 |  +-springframework
	 |     +-boot
	 |        +-loader
	 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
	 +-WEB-INF
	    +-classes
	    |  +-com
	    |     +-mycompany
	    |        +-project
	    |           +-YourClasses.class
	    +-lib
	    |  +-dependency1.jar
	    |  +-dependency2.jar
	    +-lib-provided
	       +-servlet-api.jar
	       +-dependency3.jar
----

Dependencies should be placed in a nested `WEB-INF/lib` directory.
Any dependencies that are required when running embedded but are not required when deploying to a traditional web container should be placed in `WEB-INF/lib-provided`.



[[appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.index-files]]
=== Index Files
Spring Boot Loader-compatible jar and war archives can include additional index files under the `BOOT-INF/` directory.
A `classpath.idx` file can be provided for both jars and wars, and it provides the ordering that jars should be added to the classpath.
The `layers.idx` file can be used only for jars, and it allows a jar to be split into logical layers for Docker/OCI image creation.

Index files follow a YAML compatible syntax so that they can be easily parsed by third-party tools.
These files, however, are _not_ parsed internally as YAML and they must be written in exactly the formats described below in order to be used.



[[appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.classpath-index]]
=== Classpath Index
The classpath index file can be provided in `BOOT-INF/classpath.idx`.
It provides a list of jar names (including the directory) in the order that they should be added to the classpath.
Each line must start with dash space (`"-&#183;"`) and names must be in double quotes.

For example, given the following jar:

[indent=0]
----
	example.jar
	 |
	 +-META-INF
	 |  +-...
	 +-BOOT-INF
	    +-classes
	    |  +...
	    +-lib
	       +-dependency1.jar
	       +-dependency2.jar
----

The index file would look like this:

[indent=0]
----
	- "BOOT-INF/lib/dependency2.jar"
	- "BOOT-INF/lib/dependency1.jar"
----



[[appendix.executable-jar.nested-jars.layer-index]]
=== Layer Index
The layers index file can be provided in `BOOT-INF/layers.idx`.
It provides a list of layers and the parts of the jar that should be contained within them.
Layers are written in the order that they should be added to the Docker/OCI image.
Layers names are written as quoted strings prefixed with dash space (`"-&#183;"`) and with a colon (`":"`) suffix.
Layer content is either a file or directory name written as a quoted string prefixed by space space dash space (`"&#183;&#183;-&#183;"`).
A directory name ends with `/`, a file name does not.
When a directory name is used it means that all files inside that directory are in the same layer.

A typical example of a layers index would be:

[indent=0]
----
	- "dependencies":
	  - "BOOT-INF/lib/dependency1.jar"
	  - "BOOT-INF/lib/dependency2.jar"
	- "application":
	  - "BOOT-INF/classes/"
	  - "META-INF/"
----
