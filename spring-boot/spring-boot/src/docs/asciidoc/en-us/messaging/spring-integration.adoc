== Spring Integration
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with {spring-integration}[Spring Integration], including the `spring-boot-starter-integration` "`Starter`".
Spring Integration provides abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP, and others.
If Spring Integration is available on your classpath, it is initialized through the `@EnableIntegration` annotation.

Spring Integration polling logic relies <<features#features.task-execution-and-scheduling,on the auto-configured `TaskScheduler`>>.
The default `PollerMetadata` (poll unbounded number of messages every second) can be customized with `spring.integration.poller.*` configuration properties.

Spring Boot also configures some features that are triggered by the presence of additional Spring Integration modules.
If `spring-integration-jmx` is also on the classpath, message processing statistics are published over JMX.
If `spring-integration-jdbc` is available, the default database schema can be created on startup, as shown in the following line:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  integration:
	    jdbc:
	      initialize-schema: "always"
----

If `spring-integration-rsocket` is available, developers can configure an RSocket server using `"spring.rsocket.server.*"` properties and let it use `IntegrationRSocketEndpoint` or `RSocketOutboundGateway` components to handle incoming RSocket messages.
This infrastructure can handle Spring Integration RSocket channel adapters and `@MessageMapping` handlers (given `"spring.integration.rsocket.server.message-mapping-enabled"` is configured).

Spring Boot can also auto-configure an `ClientRSocketConnector` using configuration properties:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	# Connecting to a RSocket server over TCP
	spring:
	  integration:
	    rsocket:
	      client:
	        host: "example.org"
	        port: 9898
----

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	# Connecting to a RSocket Server over WebSocket
	spring:
	  integration:
	    rsocket:
	      client:
	        uri: "ws://example.org"
----
