== Upgrading to a New Feature Release

When upgrading to a new feature release, some properties may have been renamed or removed.
Spring Boot provides a way to analyze your application's environment and print diagnostics at startup, but also temporarily migrate properties at runtime for you.
To enable that feature, add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-properties-migrator</artifactId>
		<scope>runtime</scope>
	</dependency>
----

WARNING: Properties that are added late to the environment, such as when using `@PropertySource`, will not be taken into account.

NOTE: Once you finish the migration, please make sure to remove this module from your project's dependencies.
