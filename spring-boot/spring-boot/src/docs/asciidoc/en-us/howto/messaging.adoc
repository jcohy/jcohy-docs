== Messaging
Spring Boot offers a number of starters to support messaging.
This section answers questions that arise from using messaging with Spring Boot.

=== Disable Transacted JMS Session
If your JMS broker does not support transacted sessions, you have to disable the support of transactions altogether.
If you create your own `JmsListenerContainerFactory`, there is nothing to do, since, by default it cannot be transacted.
If you want to use the `DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` to reuse Spring Boot's default, you can disable transacted sessions, as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{docs-java}/howto/messaging/disabletransactedjmssession/MyJmsConfiguration.java[]
----

The preceding example overrides the default factory, and it should be applied to any other factory that your application defines, if any.
