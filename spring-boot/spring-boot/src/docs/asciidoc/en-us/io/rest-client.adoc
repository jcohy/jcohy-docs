== Calling REST Services
If your application calls remote REST services, Spring Boot makes that very convenient using a `RestTemplate` or a `WebClient`.

[[io.rest-client.resttemplate]]
=== RestTemplate
If you need to call remote REST services from your application, you can use the Spring Framework's {spring-framework-api}/web/client/RestTemplate.html[`RestTemplate`] class.
Since `RestTemplate` instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured `RestTemplate` bean.
It does, however, auto-configure a `RestTemplateBuilder`, which can be used to create `RestTemplate` instances when needed.
The auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` ensures that sensible `HttpMessageConverters` are applied to `RestTemplate` instances.

The following code shows a typical example:

include::code:MyService[]

TIP: `RestTemplateBuilder` includes a number of useful methods that can be used to quickly configure a `RestTemplate`.
For example, to add BASIC auth support, you can use `builder.basicAuthentication("user", "password").build()`.



[[io.rest-client.resttemplate.customization]]
==== RestTemplate Customization
There are three main approaches to `RestTemplate` customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and then call its methods as required.
Each method call returns a new `RestTemplateBuilder` instance, so the customizations only affect this use of the builder.

To make an application-wide, additive customization, use a `RestTemplateCustomizer` bean.
All such beans are automatically registered with the auto-configured `RestTemplateBuilder` and are applied to any templates that are built with it.

The following example shows a customizer that configures the use of a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

include::code:MyRestTemplateCustomizer[]

Finally, you can define your own `RestTemplateBuilder` bean.
Doing so will replace the auto-configured builder.
If you want any `RestTemplateCustomizer` beans to be applied to your custom builder, as the auto-configuration would have done, configure it using a `RestTemplateBuilderConfigurer`.
The following example exposes a `RestTemplateBuilder` that matches what Spring Boot's auto-configuration would have done, except that custom connect and read timeouts are also specified:

include::code:MyRestTemplateBuilderConfiguration[]

The most extreme (and rarely used) option is to create your own `RestTemplateBuilder` bean without using a configurer.
In addition to replacing the auto-configured builder, this also prevents any `RestTemplateCustomizer` beans from being used.



[[io.rest-client.webclient]]
=== WebClient
If you have Spring WebFlux on your classpath, you can also choose to use `WebClient` to call remote REST services.
Compared to `RestTemplate`, this client has a more functional feel and is fully reactive.
You can learn more about the `WebClient` in the dedicated {spring-framework-docs}/web-reactive.html#webflux-client[section in the Spring Framework docs].

Spring Boot creates and pre-configures a `WebClient.Builder` for you.
It is strongly advised to inject it in your components and use it to create `WebClient` instances.
Spring Boot is configuring that builder to share HTTP resources, reflect codecs setup in the same fashion as the server ones (see <<web#web.reactive.webflux.httpcodecs,WebFlux HTTP codecs auto-configuration>>), and more.

The following code shows a typical example:

include::code:MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.webclient.runtime]]
==== WebClient Runtime
Spring Boot will auto-detect which `ClientHttpConnector` to use to drive `WebClient`, depending on the libraries available on the application classpath.
For now, Reactor Netty, Jetty RS client, Apache HttpClient, and the JDK's HttpClient are supported.

The `spring-boot-starter-webflux` starter depends on `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty` by default, which brings both server and client implementations.
If you choose to use Jetty as a reactive server instead, you should add a dependency on the Jetty Reactive HTTP client library, `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-reactive-httpclient`.
Using the same technology for server and client has its advantages, as it will automatically share HTTP resources between client and server.

Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom `ReactorResourceFactory` or `JettyResourceFactory` bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.

If you wish to override that choice for the client, you can define your own `ClientHttpConnector` bean and have full control over the client configuration.

You can learn more about the {spring-framework-docs}/web-reactive.html#webflux-client-builder[`WebClient` configuration options in the Spring Framework reference documentation].



[[io.rest-client.webclient.customization]]
==== WebClient Customization
There are three main approaches to `WebClient` customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured `WebClient.Builder` and then call its methods as required.
`WebClient.Builder` instances are stateful: Any change on the builder is reflected in all clients subsequently created with it.
If you want to create several clients with the same builder, you can also consider cloning the builder with `WebClient.Builder other = builder.clone();`.

To make an application-wide, additive customization to all `WebClient.Builder` instances, you can declare `WebClientCustomizer` beans and change the `WebClient.Builder` locally at the point of injection.

Finally, you can fall back to the original API and use `WebClient.create()`.
In that case, no auto-configuration or `WebClientCustomizer` is applied.
