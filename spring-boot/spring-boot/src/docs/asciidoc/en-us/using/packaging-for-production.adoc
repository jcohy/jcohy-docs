== Packaging Your Application for Production
Executable jars can be used for production deployment.
As they are self-contained, they are also ideally suited for cloud-based deployment.

For additional "`production ready`" features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end-points, consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`.
See _<<actuator#actuator>>_ for details.
