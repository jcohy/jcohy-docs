[[health.retrieving]]
== Retrieving the Health of the Application
To retrieve the health of the application, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/health`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/health/curl-request.adoc[]

The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]



[[health.retrieving.response-structure]]
=== Response Structure
The response contains details of the health of the application.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="2,1,3"]
include::{snippets}/health/response-fields.adoc[]

NOTE: The response fields above are for the V3 API.
If you need to return V2 JSON you should use an accept header or `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json`



[[health.retrieving-component]]
== Retrieving the Health of a Component
To retrieve the health of a particular component of the application's health, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/health/\{component}`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/health/component/curl-request.adoc[]

The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/health/component/http-response.adoc[]



[[health.retrieving-component.response-structure]]
=== Response Structure
The response contains details of the health of a particular component of the application's health.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="2,1,3"]
include::{snippets}/health/component/response-fields.adoc[]



[[health.retrieving-component-nested]]
== Retrieving the Health of a Nested Component
If a particular component contains other nested components (as the `broker` indicator in the example above), the health of such a nested component can be retrieved by issuing a `GET` request to `/actuator/health/\{component}/\{subcomponent}`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/health/instance/curl-request.adoc[]

The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/health/instance/http-response.adoc[]

Components of an application's health may be nested arbitrarily deep depending on the application's health indicators and how they have been grouped.
The health endpoint supports any number of `/\{component}` identifiers in the URL to allow the health of a component at any depth to be retrieved.



[[health.retrieving-component-nested.response-structure]]
=== Response Structure
The response contains details of the health of an instance of a particular component of the application.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="2,1,3"]
include::{snippets}/health/instance/response-fields.adoc[]
