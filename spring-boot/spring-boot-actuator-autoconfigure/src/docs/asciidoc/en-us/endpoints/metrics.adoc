[[metrics]]
= Metrics (`metrics`)
The `metrics` endpoint provides access to application metrics.



[[metrics.retrieving-names]]
== Retrieving Metric Names
To retrieve the names of the available metrics, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/metrics`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/metrics/names/curl-request.adoc[]

The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/metrics/names/http-response.adoc[]



[[metrics.retrieving-names.response-structure]]
=== Response Structure
The response contains details of the metric names.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="3,1,2"]
include::{snippets}/metrics/names/response-fields.adoc[]



[[metrics.retrieving-metric]]
== Retrieving a Metric
To retrieve a metric, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/metrics/{metric.name}`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/metrics/metric/curl-request.adoc[]

The preceding example retrieves information about the metric named `jvm.memory.max`.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/metrics/metric/http-response.adoc[]



[[metrics.retrieving-metric.query-parameters]]
=== Query Parameters
The endpoint uses query parameters to <<metrics.drilling-down,drill down>> into a metric by using its tags.
The following table shows the single supported query parameter:

[cols="2,4"]
include::{snippets}/metrics/metric-with-tags/request-parameters.adoc[]



[[metrics.retrieving-metric.response-structure]]
=== Response structure
The response contains details of the metric.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

include::{snippets}/metrics/metric/response-fields.adoc[]



[[metrics.drilling-down]]
== Drilling Down
To drill down into a metric, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/metrics/{metric.name}` using the `tag` query parameter, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/metrics/metric-with-tags/curl-request.adoc[]

The preceding example retrieves the `jvm.memory.max` metric, where the `area` tag has a value of `nonheap` and the `id` attribute has a value of `Compressed Class Space`.
The resulting response is similar to the following:
