The following table shows the supported query parameters:

[cols="2,4"]
include::{snippets}/caches/named/request-parameters.adoc[]



[[caches.named.response-structure]]
=== Response Structure
The response contains details of the requested cache.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

[[caches.evict-named.request-structure]]
=== Request Structure
If the requested name is specific enough to identify a single cache, no extra parameter is required.
Otherwise, the `cacheManager` must be specified.
