This API documentation describes Spring Boot Actuators web endpoints.



[[overview]]
== Overview
Before you proceed, you should read the following topics:

* <<overview.endpoint-urls>>
* <<overview.timestamps>>

NOTE: In order to get the correct JSON responses documented below, Jackson must be available.



[[overview.endpoint-urls]]
=== URLs
By default, all web endpoints are available beneath the path `/actuator` with URLs of
the form `/actuator/\{id}`. The `/actuator` base path can be configured by using the
`management.endpoints.web.base-path` property, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.endpoints.web.base-path=/manage
----

The preceding `application.properties` example changes the form of the endpoint URLs from
`/actuator/\{id}` to `/manage/\{id}`. For example, the URL `info` endpoint would become
`/manage/info`.



[[overview.timestamps]]
=== Timestamps
All timestamps that are consumed by the endpoints, either as query parameters or in the
request body, must be formatted as an offset date and time as specified in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601].
