The term bootstrapping refers to initializing and starting a software component.
In Hibernate, we are specifically talking about the process of building a fully functional `SessionFactory` instance or `EntityManagerFactory` instance, for JPA.
The process is very different for each.

[TIP]
====
During the bootstrap process, you might want to customize Hibernate behavior so make sure you check the <<appendices/Configurations.adoc#configurations,Configurations>> section as well.

[[bootstrap-native]]
=== Native Bootstrapping

This section discusses the process of bootstrapping a Hibernate `SessionFactory`.
Specifically, it addresses the bootstrapping APIs as redesigned in 5.0.
For a discussion of the legacy bootstrapping API, see <<appendices/Legacy_Bootstrap.adoc#appendix-legacy-bootstrap,Legacy Bootstrapping>>.

[[bootstrap-native-registry]]
==== Building the ServiceRegistry

The first step in native bootstrapping is the building of a `ServiceRegistry` holding the services Hibernate will need during bootstrapping and at run time.

Actually, we are concerned with building 2 different ServiceRegistries.
First is the `org.hibernate.boot.registry.BootstrapServiceRegistry`.
The `BootstrapServiceRegistry` is intended to hold services that Hibernate needs at both bootstrap and run time.
This boils down to 3 services:

`org.hibernate.boot.registry.classloading.spi.ClassLoaderService`:: which controls how Hibernate interacts with ``ClassLoader``s.
`org.hibernate.integrator.spi.IntegratorService`:: which controls the management and discovery of `org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator` instances.
`org.hibernate.boot.registry.selector.spi.StrategySelector`:: which controls how Hibernate resolves implementations of various strategy contracts.
This is a very powerful service, but a full discussion of it is beyond the scope of this guide.

[NOTE]
====
If you are ok with the default behavior of Hibernate in regards to these `BootstrapServiceRegistry` services
(which is quite often the case, especially in stand-alone environments), then you don't need to explicitly build the `BootstrapServiceRegistry`.
====

If you wish to alter how the `BootstrapServiceRegistry` is built, that is controlled through the `org.hibernate.boot.registry.BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder`:

====

[NOTE]
====
The services of the `BootstrapServiceRegistry` cannot be extended (added to) nor overridden (replaced).
====

The second ServiceRegistry is the `org.hibernate.boot.registry.StandardServiceRegistry`.
You will almost always need to configure the `StandardServiceRegistry`, which is done through `org.hibernate.boot.registry.StandardServiceRegistryBuilder`:

include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-bootstrap-native-registry-StandardServiceRegistryBuilder-example]

A `StandardServiceRegistry` is also highly configurable via the StandardServiceRegistryBuilder API.
See the `StandardServiceRegistryBuilder` https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/registry/StandardServiceRegistryBuilder.html[Javadocs] for more details.

Some specific methods of interest:

[[bootstrap-event-listener-registration]]
==== Event Listener registration

The main use cases for an `org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator` right now are registering event listeners and providing services (see `org.hibernate.integrator.spi.ServiceContributingIntegrator`).
With 5.0 we plan on expanding that to allow altering the metamodel describing the mapping between object and relational models.

include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-event-listener-registration-example]
----
====

[[bootstrap-native-metadata]]
==== Building the Metadata

The second step in native bootstrapping is the building of an `org.hibernate.boot.Metadata` object containing the parsed representations of an application domain model and its mapping to a database.
The first thing we obviously need to build a parsed representation is the source information to be parsed (annotated classes, `hbm.xml` files, `orm.xml` files).
This is the purpose of `org.hibernate.boot.MetadataSources`.

`MetadataSources` has many other methods as well. Explore its API and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html[Javadocs] for more information.
Also, all methods on `MetadataSources` offer fluent-style call chaining::

.Configuring a `MetadataSources` with method chaining
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-native-metadata-source-example]
----
====

Once we have the sources of mapping information defined, we need to build the `Metadata` object.
If you are ok with the default behavior in building the Metadata then you can simply call the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html#buildMetadata--[`buildMetadata`] method of the `MetadataSources`.

[NOTE]
====
Notice that a `ServiceRegistry` can be passed at a number of points in this bootstrapping process.
The suggested approach is to build a `StandardServiceRegistry` yourself and pass that along to the `MetadataSources` constructor.
From there, `MetadataBuilder`, `Metadata`, `SessionFactoryBuilder`, and `SessionFactory` will all pick up that same `StandardServiceRegistry`.
====

However, if you wish to adjust the process of building `Metadata` from `MetadataSources`,
you will need to use the `MetadataBuilder` as obtained via `MetadataSources#getMetadataBuilder`.
`MetadataBuilder` allows a lot of control over the `Metadata` building process.
See its https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataBuilder.html[Javadocs] for full details.

[[bootstrap-native-SessionFactory]]
==== Building the SessionFactory

The final step in native bootstrapping is to build the `SessionFactory` itself.
Much like discussed above, if you are ok with the default behavior of building a `SessionFactory` from a `Metadata` reference, you can simply call the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/Metadata.html#buildSessionFactory--[`buildSessionFactory`] method on the `Metadata` object.

However, if you would like to adjust that building process, you will need to use `SessionFactoryBuilder` as obtained via `Metadata#getSessionFactoryBuilder`. Again, see its https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/Metadata.html#getSessionFactoryBuilder--[Javadocs] for more details.

The bootstrapping API is quite flexible, but in most cases it makes the most sense to think of it as a 3 step process:

1. Build the `StandardServiceRegistry`
2. Build the `Metadata`
3. Use those 2 to build the `SessionFactory`

[[bootstrap-jpa]]
=== JPA Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping Hibernate as a JPA provider can be done in a JPA-spec compliant manner or using a proprietary bootstrapping approach.
The standardized approach has some limitations in certain environments, but aside from those, it is *highly* recommended that you use JPA-standardized bootstrapping.

[[bootstrap-jpa-compliant]]
==== JPA-compliant bootstrapping

In JPA, we are ultimately interested in bootstrapping a `javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory` instance.
The JPA specification defines two primary standardized bootstrap approaches depending on how the application intends to access the `javax.persistence.EntityManager` instances from an `EntityManagerFactory`.

It uses the terms _EE_ and _SE_ for these two approaches, but those terms are very misleading in this context.
What the JPA spec calls EE bootstrapping implies the existence of a container (EE, OSGi, etc), who'll manage and inject the persistence context on behalf of the application.
What it calls SE bootstrapping is everything else. We will use the terms container-bootstrapping and application-bootstrapping in this guide.

For compliant container-bootstrapping, the container will build an `EntityManagerFactory` for each persistent-unit defined in the `META-INF/persistence.xml` configuration file
and make that available to the application for injection via the `javax.persistence.PersistenceUnit` annotation or via JNDI lookup.

.Injecting the default `EntityManagerFactory`

include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-jpa-compliant-PersistenceUnit-example]
----
====

Or, in case you have multiple Persistence Units (e.g. multiple `persistence.xml` configuration files),
you can inject a specific `EntityManagerFactory` by Unit name:

[[bootstrap-jpa-compliant-PersistenceUnit-configurable-example]]
.Injecting a specific `EntityManagerFactory`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]

include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-jpa-compliant-PersistenceUnit-configurable-example]

The `META-INF/persistence.xml` file looks as follows:

[[bootstrap-jpa-compliant-persistence-xml-example]]
.META-INF/persistence.xml configuration file
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/persistence.xml[]
----
====

For compliant application-bootstrapping, rather than the container building the `EntityManagerFactory` for the application, the application builds the `EntityManagerFactory` itself using the `javax.persistence.Persistence` bootstrap class.
The application creates an `EntityManagerFactory` by calling the `createEntityManagerFactory` method:

[[bootstrap-jpa-compliant-EntityManagerFactory-example]]
.Application bootstrapped `EntityManagerFactory`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BootstrapTest.java[tags=bootstrap-jpa-compliant-EntityManagerFactory-example]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If you don't want to provide a `persistence.xml` configuration file, JPA allows you to provide all the configuration options in a
{jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}spi/PersistenceUnitInfo.html[`PersistenceUnitInfo`] implementation and call
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/jpa/HibernatePersistenceProvider.html#createContainerEntityManagerFactory-javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceUnitInfo-java.util.Map-[`HibernatePersistenceProvider.html#createContainerEntityManagerFactory`].
====

To inject the default Persistence Context, you can use the {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}PersistenceContext.html[`@PersistenceContext`] annotation.

To inject a specific Persistence Context,
you can use the {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}PersistenceContext.html[`@PersistenceContext`] annotation,
and you can even pass `EntityManager`-specific properties using the
{jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}PersistenceProperty.html[`@PersistenceProperty`] annotation.

[NOTE]
====
If you would like additional details on accessing and using `EntityManager` instances, sections 7.6 and 7.7 of the JPA 2.1 specification cover container-managed and application-managed `EntityManagers`, respectively.
====

[[bootstrap-jpa-xml-files]]
==== Externalizing XML mapping files

JPA offers two mapping options:

- annotations
- XML mappings

Although annotations are much more common, there are projects where XML mappings are preferred.
You can even mix annotations and XML mappings so that you can override annotation mappings with XML configurations that can be easily changed without recompiling the project source code.
This is possible because if there are two conflicting mappings, the XML mappings take precedence over its annotation counterpart.

The JPA specification requires the XML mappings to be located on the classpath:

[quote, Section 8.2.1.6.2 of the JPA 2.1 Specification]
____
An object/relational mapping XML file named `orm.xml` may be specified in the `META-INF` directory in the root of the persistence unit or in the `META-INF` directory of any jar file referenced by the `persistence.xml`.

Alternatively, or in addition, one or more mapping files may be referenced by the mapping-file elements of the persistence-unit element. These mapping files may be present anywhere on the classpath.
____

Therefore, the mapping files can reside in the application jar artifacts, or they can be stored in an external folder location with the cogitation that that location be included in the classpath.

Hibernate is more lenient in this regard so you can use any external location even outside of the application configured classpath.

.META-INF/persistence.xml configuration file for external XML mappings
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/persistence-external.xml[]
----
====

In the `persistence.xml` configuration file above, the `orm.xml` XML file containing all JPA entity mappings is located in the `/etc/opt/app/mappings/` folder.

[[bootstrap-jpa-metadata]]
==== Configuring the `SessionFactory` `Metadata` via the JPA bootstrap

As previously seen, the Hibernate native bootstrap mechanism allows you to customize a great variety of configurations which are passed via the `Metadata` object.

When using Hibernate as a JPA provider, the `EntityManagerFactory` is backed by a `SessionFactory`. For this reason, you might still want to use the `Metadata` object to pass various settings which cannot be supplied via the standard Hibernate <<appendices/Configurations.adoc, configuration settings>>.

For this reason, you can use the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/spi/MetadataBuilderContributor.html[`MetadataBuilderContributor`] class as you can see in the following examples.

[[bootstrap-jpa-compliant-MetadataBuilderContributor-example]]
.Implementing a `MetadataBuilderContributor`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{boot-spi-sourcedir}/metadatabuildercontributor/SqlFunctionMetadataBuilderContributor.java[tags=bootstrap-jpa-compliant-MetadataBuilderContributor-example]
----
====

The above `MetadataBuilderContributor` is used to register a `SqlFuction` which is not defined by the currently running Hibernate `Dialect`, but which we need to reference in our JPQL queries.

By having access to the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataBuilder.html[`MetadataBuilder`] class that's used by the underlying `SessionFactory`, the JPA bootstrap becomes just as flexible as the Hibernate native bootstrap mechanism.

You can then pass the custom `MetadataBuilderContributor` via the `hibernate.metadata_builder_contributor` configuration property as explained in the <<appendices/Configurations.adoc#configurations-bootstrap, Configuration chapter>>.
