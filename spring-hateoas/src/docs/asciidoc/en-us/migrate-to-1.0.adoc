[[migrate-to-1.0]]
= Migrating to Spring HATEOAS 1.0

For 1.0 we took the chance to re-evaluate some of the design and package structure choices we had made for the 0.x branch.
There had been an incredible amount of feedback on it and the major version bump seemed to be the most natural place to refactor those.

[[migrate-to-1.0.changes]]
== The changes

The biggest changes in package structure were driven by the introduction of a hypermedia type registration API to support additional media types in Spring HATEOAS.
This lead to the clear separation of client and server APIs (packages named respectively) as well as media type implementations in the package `mediatype`.

The easiest way to get your code base upgraded to the new API is by using the <<migrate-to-1.0.script, migration script>>.
Before we jump to that, here are the changes at a quick glance.

[[migrate-to-1.0.changes.representation-models]]
=== Representation models

The `ResourceSupport`/`Resource`/`Resources`/`PagedResources` group of classes never really felt appropriately named.
After all, these types do not actually manifest resources but rather representation models that can be enriched with hypermedia information and affordances.
Here's how new names map to the old ones:

* `ResourceSupport` is now `RepresentationModel`
* `Resource` is now `EntityModel`
* `Resources` is now `CollectionModel`
* `PagedResources` is now `PagedModel`

Consequently, `ResourceAssembler` has been renamed to `RepresentationModelAssembler` and its methods `toResource(…)` and `toResources(…)` have been renamed to `toModel(…)` and `toCollectionModel(…)` respectively.
Also the name changes have been reflected in the classes contained in `TypeReferences`.

* `RepresentationModel.getLinks()` now exposes a `Links` instance (over a `List<Link>`) as that exposes additional API to concatenate and merge different `Links` instances using various strategies.
  Also it has been turned into a self-bound generic type to allow the methods that add links to the instance return the instance itself.
* The `LinkDiscoverer` API has been moved to the `client` package.
* The `LinkBuilder` and `EntityLinks` APIs have been moved to the `server` package.
* `ControllerLinkBuilder` has been moved into `server.mvc` and deprecated to be replaced by `WebMvcLinkBuilder`.
* `RelProvider` has been renamed to `LinkRelationProvider` and returns `LinkRelation` instances instead of ``String``s.
* `VndError` has been moved to the `mediatype.vnderror` package.

[[migrate-to-1.0.script]]
== The migration script

You can find https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/tree/main/etc[a script] to run from your application root that will update all import statements and static method references to Spring HATEOAS types that moved in our source code repository.
Simply download that, run it from your project root.
By default it will inspect all Java source files and replace the legacy Spring HATEOAS type references with the new ones.

.Sample application of the migration script
====
[source]
----
$ ./migrate-to-1.0.sh

Migrating Spring HATEOAS references to 1.0 for files : *.java

Adapting ./src/main/java/…
…

Done!

Note that the script will not necessarily be able to entirely fix all changes, but it should cover the most important refactorings.

Now verify the changes made to the files in your favorite Git client and commit as appropriate.
In case you find method or type references unmigrated, please open a ticket in out issue tracker.

[[migration.1-0-M3-to-1-0-RC1]]
== Migrating from 1.0 M3 to 1.0 RC1

- `Link.andAffordance(…)` taking Affordance details have been moved to `Affordances`. To manually build up `Affordance` instances now use `Affordances.of(link).afford(…)`. Also note the new `AffordanceBuilder` type exposed from `Affordances` for fluent usage. See <<server.affordances>> for details.
- `AffordanceModelFactory.getAffordanceModel(…)` now receives `InputPayloadMetadata` and `PayloadMetadata` instances instead of ``ResolvableType``s to allow non-type-based implementations. Custom media type implementations have to be adapted to that accordingly.
- HAL Forms now does not render property attributes if their value adheres to what's defined as default in the spec. I.e. if previously `required` was explicitly set to `false`, we now just omit the entry for `required`.
We also now only force them to be non-required for templates that use `PATCH` as the HTTP method.
