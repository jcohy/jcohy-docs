== The HAL Browser

The developer of the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL specification] has a useful application: https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[the HAL Browser]. It is a web application that stirs in a little HAL-powered JavaScript. You can point it at any Spring Data REST API and use it to navigate the app and create new resources.

Instead of pulling down the files, embedding them in your application, and crafting a Spring MVC controller to serve them up, all you need to do is add a single dependency.

The following listing shows how to add the dependency in Maven:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-browser</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
====

The following listing shows how to add the dependency in Gradle:

====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.data:spring-data-rest-hal-browser'
}
----
====

NOTE: If you use Spring Boot or the Spring Data BOM (bill of materials), you do not need to specify the version.

This dependency auto-configures the HAL Browser to be served up when you visit your application's root URI in a browser. (NOTE: http://localhost:8080 was plugged into the browser, and it redirected to the URL shown in the following image.)

The preceding screen shot shows the root path of the API. On the right side are details from the response, including headers and the body (a HAL document).

The HAL Browser reads the links from the response and puts them in a list on the left side. You can either click on the *GET* button and navigate to one of the collections, or click on the *NON-GET* option to make changes.

The HAL Browser speaks *URI Template*. Above the *GET* button and next to *persons*, the UI has a question mark icon. An expansion dialog pops up if you choose to navigate to it, as follows:

If you click *Follow URI* without entering anything, the variables are essentially ignored. For situations like <<projections-excerpts>> or <<paging-and-sorting>>, this can be useful.

When you click on a *NON-GET* button, a pop-up dialog appears. By default, it shows *POST*. This field can be adjusted to either *PUT* or *PATCH*. The headers are filled out to properly to submit a new JSON document.

Below the URI, method, and headers are the fields. These are automatically supplied, depending on the metadata of the resources, which was automatically generated by Spring Data REST. If you update your domain objects, the pop-up reflects it, as the following image shows:
