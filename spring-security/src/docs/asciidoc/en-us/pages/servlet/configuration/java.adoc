= Java Configuration

General support for https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-java[Java Configuration] was added to Spring Framework in Spring 3.1.
Since Spring Security 3.2 there has been Spring Security Java Configuration support which enables users to easily configure Spring Security without the use of any XML.

If you are familiar with the xref:servlet/configuration/xml-namespace.adoc#ns-config[Security Namespace Configuration] then you should find quite a few similarities between it and the Security Java Configuration support.

NOTE: Spring Security provides https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/tree/main/servlet/java-configuration[lots of sample applications] which demonstrate the use of Spring Security Java Configuration.

== Hello Web Security Java Configuration

The first step is to create our Spring Security Java Configuration.
The configuration creates a Servlet Filter known as the `springSecurityFilterChain` which is responsible for all the security (protecting the application URLs, validating submitted username and passwords, redirecting to the log in form, etc) within your application.
You can find the most basic example of a Spring Security Java Configuration below:

[[jc-hello-wsca]]
[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.*;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.*;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig {

	@Bean
	public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
		InMemoryUserDetailsManager manager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();
		manager.createUser(User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder().username("user").password("password").roles("USER").build());
		return manager;
	}
}
----

There really isn't much to this configuration, but it does a lot.
You can find a summary of the features below:

* Require authentication to every URL in your application
* Generate a login form for you
* Allow the user with the *Username* _user_ and the *Password* _password_ to authenticate with form based authentication
* Allow the user to logout
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF attack] prevention
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation[Session Fixation] protection
* Security Header integration
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security[HTTP Strict Transport Security] for secure requests
** https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622941(v=vs.85).aspx[X-Content-Type-Options] integration
** Cache Control (can be overridden later by your application to allow caching of your static resources)
** https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565647(v=vs.85).aspx[X-XSS-Protection] integration
** X-Frame-Options integration to help prevent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking[Clickjacking]

** https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#logout()[HttpServletRequest#logout()]

=== AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer

The next step is to register the `springSecurityFilterChain` with the war.
This can be done in Java Configuration with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-container-config[Spring's WebApplicationInitializer support] in a Servlet 3.0+ environment.
Not suprisingly, Spring Security provides a base class `AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer` that will ensure the `springSecurityFilterChain` gets registered for you.
The way in which we use `AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer` differs depending on if we are already using Spring or if Spring Security is the only Spring component in our application.

* <<abstractsecuritywebapplicationinitializer-without-existing-spring>> - Use these instructions if you are not using Spring already
* <<abstractsecuritywebapplicationinitializer-with-spring-mvc>> - Use these instructions if you are already using Spring

[[abstractsecuritywebapplicationinitializer-without-existing-spring]]
=== AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer without Existing Spring

If you are not using Spring or Spring MVC, you will need to pass in the `WebSecurityConfig` into the superclass to ensure the configuration is picked up.
You can find an example below:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.security.web.context.*;

public class SecurityWebApplicationInitializer
	extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer {

	public SecurityWebApplicationInitializer() {
		super(WebSecurityConfig.class);
	}
}
----

The `SecurityWebApplicationInitializer` will do the following things:

* Automatically register the springSecurityFilterChain Filter for every URL in your application
* Add a ContextLoaderListener that loads the <<jc-hello-wsca,WebSecurityConfig>>.

[[abstractsecuritywebapplicationinitializer-with-spring-mvc]]
=== AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer with Spring MVC

If we were using Spring elsewhere in our application we probably already had a `WebApplicationInitializer` that is loading our Spring Configuration.
If we use the previous configuration we would get an error.
Instead, we should register Spring Security with the existing `ApplicationContext`.
For example, if we were using Spring MVC our `SecurityWebApplicationInitializer` would look something like the following:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.security.web.context.*;

public class SecurityWebApplicationInitializer
	extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer {

}
----

This would simply only register the springSecurityFilterChain Filter for every URL in your application.
After that we would ensure that `WebSecurityConfig` was loaded in our existing ApplicationInitializer.
For example, if we were using Spring MVC it would be added in the `getRootConfigClasses()`

[[message-web-application-inititializer-java]]
[source,java]
----
public class MvcWebApplicationInitializer extends
		AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {

	@Override
	protected Class<?>[] getRootConfigClasses() {
		return new Class[] { WebSecurityConfig.class };
	}

	// ... other overrides ...
}
----

[[jc-httpsecurity]]
== HttpSecurity

Thus far our <<jc-hello-wsca,WebSecurityConfig>> only contains information about how to authenticate our users.
How does Spring Security know that we want to require all users to be authenticated?
How does Spring Security know we want to support form based authentication?
Actually, there is a configuration class that is being invoked behind the scenes called `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
It has a method called `configure` with the following default implementation:

[source,java]
----
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
		.authorizeRequests(authorize -> authorize
			.anyRequest().authenticated()
		)
		.formLogin(withDefaults())
		.httpBasic(withDefaults());
}
----

The default configuration above:

* Ensures that any request to our application requires the user to be authenticated
* Allows users to authenticate with form based login
* Allows users to authenticate with HTTP Basic authentication

You will notice that this configuration is quite similar the XML Namespace configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="authenticated"/>
	<form-login />
	<http-basic />
</http>
----

== Multiple HttpSecurity

We can configure multiple HttpSecurity instances just as we can have multiple `<http>` blocks.
The key is to extend the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` multiple times.
For example, the following is an example of having a different configuration for URL's that start with `/api/`.

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class MultiHttpSecurityConfig {
	@Bean                                                             <1>
	public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() throws Exception {
		// ensure the passwords are encoded properly
		UserBuilder users = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder();
		InMemoryUserDetailsManager manager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();
		manager.createUser(users.username("user").password("password").roles("USER").build());
		manager.createUser(users.username("admin").password("password").roles("USER","ADMIN").build());
		return manager;
	}

	@Configuration
	@Order(1)                                                        <2>
	public static class ApiWebSecurityConfigurationAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
		protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
			http
				.antMatcher("/api/**")                               <3>
				.authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
					.anyRequest().hasRole("ADMIN")
			    )
				.httpBasic(withDefaults());
		}
	}

	@Configuration                                                   <4>
	public static class FormLoginWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

		@Override
		protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
			http
				.authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
					.anyRequest().authenticated()
				)
				.formLogin(withDefaults());
		}
	}
}
----

<1> Configure Authentication as normal
<2> Create an instance of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` that contains `@Order` to specify which `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` should be considered first.
<3> The `http.antMatcher` states that this `HttpSecurity` will only be applicable to URLs that start with `/api/`
<4> Create another instance of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
If the URL does not start with `/api/` this configuration will be used.
This configuration is considered after `ApiWebSecurityConfigurationAdapter` since it has an `@Order` value after `1` (no `@Order` defaults to last).

[[jc-custom-dsls]]
== Custom DSLs

You can provide your own custom DSLs in Spring Security.
For example, you might have something that looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyCustomDsl extends AbstractHttpConfigurer<MyCustomDsl, HttpSecurity> {
	private boolean flag;

	@Override
	public void init(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		// any method that adds another configurer
		// must be done in the init method
		http.csrf().disable();
	}

	@Override
	public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		ApplicationContext context = http.getSharedObject(ApplicationContext.class);

		// here we lookup from the ApplicationContext. You can also just create a new instance.
		MyFilter myFilter = context.getBean(MyFilter.class);
		myFilter.setFlag(flag);
		http.addFilterBefore(myFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
	}

	public MyCustomDsl flag(boolean value) {
		this.flag = value;
		return this;
	}

	public static MyCustomDsl customDsl() {
		return new MyCustomDsl();
	}
}
----

NOTE: This is actually how methods like `HttpSecurity.authorizeRequests()` are implemented.

The custom DSL can then be used like this:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class Config extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http
			.apply(customDsl())
				.flag(true)
				.and()
			...;
	}
}
----

The code is invoked in the following order:

* Code in `Config`s configure method is invoked
* Code in `MyCustomDsl`s init method is invoked
* Code in `MyCustomDsl`s configure method is invoked

If you want, you can have `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` add `MyCustomDsl` by default by using `SpringFactories`.
For example, you would create a resource on the classpath named `META-INF/spring.factories` with the following contents:

.META-INF/spring.factories
----
org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.AbstractHttpConfigurer = sample.MyCustomDsl
----

Users wishing to disable the default can do so explicitly.

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class Config extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http
			.apply(customDsl()).disable()
			...;
	}
}
----

[[post-processing-configured-objects]]
== Post Processing Configured Objects

Spring Security's Java Configuration does not expose every property of every object that it configures.
This simplifies the configuration for a majority of users.
Afterall, if every property was exposed, users could use standard bean configuration.

While there are good reasons to not directly expose every property, users may still need more advanced configuration options.
To address this Spring Security introduces the concept of an `ObjectPostProcessor` which can be used to modify or replace many of the Object instances created by the Java Configuration.
For example, if you wanted to configure the `filterSecurityPublishAuthorizationSuccess` property on `FilterSecurityInterceptor` you could use the following:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
		.authorizeRequests(authorize -> authorize
			.anyRequest().authenticated()
			.withObjectPostProcessor(new ObjectPostProcessor<FilterSecurityInterceptor>() {
				public <O extends FilterSecurityInterceptor> O postProcess(
						O fsi) {
					fsi.setPublishAuthorizationSuccess(true);
					return fsi;
				}
			})
		);
}
----
