Spring Security provides integrations with numerous frameworks and APIs.
In this section, we discuss generic integrations that are not specific to Servlet or Reactive environments.
To see specific integrations, refer to the xref:servlet/integrations/index.adoc[Servlet] and xref:servlet/integrations/index.adoc[Reactive] Integrations sections.
// FIXME add link to reactive integrations
