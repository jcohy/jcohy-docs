= Anonymous

____
Anonymous version of the Micrometer.observation(), when the sequence hasn't been explicitly named via e.g. Flux#name(String) operator.
____


**Metric name** `reactor.observation`. **Type** `timer`.

**Metric name** `reactor.observation.active`. **Type** `long task timer`.


IMPORTANT: KeyValues that are added after starting the Observation might be missing from the *.active metrics.


IMPORTANT: Micrometer internally uses `nanoseconds` for the baseunit. However, each backend determines the actual baseunit. (i.e. Prometheus uses seconds)
