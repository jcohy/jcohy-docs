Spring Boot provides a starter for building GraphQL applications with Spring for GraphQL.
For version information, see the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/wiki/Spring-for-GraphQL-Versions[Spring for GraphQL Versions] wiki page.

The easiest way to get started is via https://start.spring.io by selecting
"Spring for GraphQL" along with an underlying transport such as Spring MVC of WebFlux over
HTTP or WebSocket, or over RSocket. Refer to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web.graphql[Spring for GraphQL Starter]
section in the Spring Boot reference for details on supported transports, auto-configuration related
features, and more. For testing support, see
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.testing.spring-boot-applications.spring-graphql-tests[Auto-Configured GraphQL Tests].
