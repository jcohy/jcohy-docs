NOTE: You can open this sample inside an IDE using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ's Gradle import] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how to structure a software product that consists of multiple components as a set of connected Gradle builds.
As such, it shows how Gradle is used to model a project's architecture and reflect that in the physical structure of the files that make up the software.
This example is described as part of the link:{userManualPath}/structuring_software_products.html[documentation on this topic].

The product that is built in this sample is an application that displays link:https://gradle.org/releases/[Gradle Build Tool releases].

There are different ways to work with the sample:

- You may build or import the umbrella build in the root.
  There you can, for example, run the Spring Boot web application via `./gradlew :server-application:app:bootRun` or install the Android app using `./gradlew :android-app:app:installDebug`.
- You may only build or import one of the application builds directly.
  For example, `cd server-application` and run the app using  `../gradlew :app:bootRun`.
- You may only build or import a selected component (and its dependencies).
  For example, only import the `user-feature` build in the IDE.
