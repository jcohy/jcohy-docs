= Testing Client Applications

You can use client-side tests to test code that internally uses the `RestTemplate`. The
idea is to declare expected requests and to provide "`stub`" responses so that you can
focus on testing the code in isolation (that is, without running a server). The following
example shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build();
	mockServer.expect(requestTo("/greeting")).andRespond(withSuccess());

	// Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ...

	mockServer.verify();
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	val restTemplate = RestTemplate()

	val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build()
	mockServer.expect(requestTo("/greeting")).andRespond(withSuccess())

	// Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ...

	mockServer.verify()
----

In the preceding example, `MockRestServiceServer` (the central class for client-side REST
tests) configures the `RestTemplate` with a custom `ClientHttpRequestFactory` that
asserts actual requests against expectations and returns "`stub`" responses. In this
case, we expect a request to `/greeting` and want to return a 200 response with
`text/plain` content. We can define additional expected requests and stub responses as
needed. When we define expected requests and stub responses, the `RestTemplate` can be
used in client-side code as usual. At the end of testing, `mockServer.verify()` can be
used to verify that all expectations have been satisfied.

By default, requests are expected in the order in which expectations were declared. You
can set the `ignoreExpectOrder` option when building the server, in which case all
expectations are checked (in order) to find a match for a given request. That means
requests are allowed to come in any order. The following example uses `ignoreExpectOrder`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build();
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build()
----

Even with unordered requests by default, each request is allowed to run once only.
The `expect` method provides an overloaded variant that accepts an `ExpectedCount`
argument that specifies a count range (for example, `once`, `manyTimes`, `max`, `min`,
`between`, and so on). The following example uses `times`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build();
	mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo("/something")).andRespond(withSuccess());
	mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo("/somewhere")).andRespond(withSuccess());

	// ...

	mockServer.verify();
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	val restTemplate = RestTemplate()

	val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build()
	mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo("/something")).andRespond(withSuccess())
	mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo("/somewhere")).andRespond(withSuccess())

	// ...

	mockServer.verify()
----

Note that, when `ignoreExpectOrder` is not set (the default), and, therefore, requests
are expected in order of declaration, then that order applies only to the first of any
expected request. For example if "/something" is expected two times followed by
"/somewhere" three times, then there should be a request to "/something" before there is
a request to "/somewhere", but, aside from that subsequent "/something" and "/somewhere",
requests can come at any time.

As an alternative to all of the above, the client-side test support also provides a
`ClientHttpRequestFactory` implementation that you can configure into a `RestTemplate` to
bind it to a `MockMvc` instance. That allows processing requests using actual server-side
logic but without running a server. The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Java
----
	MockMvc mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build();
	this.restTemplate = new RestTemplate(new MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc));

	// Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ...
----
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
	val mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build()
	restTemplate = RestTemplate(MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc))

	// Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ...
----

== Static Imports

As with server-side tests, the fluent API for client-side tests requires a few static
imports. Those are easy to find by searching for `MockRest*`. Eclipse users should add
`MockRestRequestMatchers.{asterisk}` and `MockRestResponseCreators.{asterisk}` as
"`favorite static members`" in the Eclipse preferences under Java -> Editor -> Content
Assist -> Favorites. That allows using content assist after typing the first character of
the static method name. Other IDEs (such IntelliJ) may not require any additional
configuration. Check for the support for code completion on static members.
