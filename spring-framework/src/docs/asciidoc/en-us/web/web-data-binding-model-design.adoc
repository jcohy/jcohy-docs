In the context of web applications, _data binding_ involves the binding of HTTP request
parameters (that is, form data or query parameters) to properties in a model object and
its nested objects.

Only `public` properties following the
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javabeans-spec.html[JavaBeans naming conventions]
are exposed for data binding â€” for example, `public String getFirstName()` and
`public void setFirstName(String)` methods for a `firstName` property.

TIP: The model object, and its nested object graph, is also sometimes referred to as a
_command object_, _form-backing object_, or _POJO_ (Plain Old Java Object).

By default, Spring permits binding to all public properties in the model object graph.
This means you need to carefully consider what public properties the model has, since a
client could target any public property path, even some that are not expected to be
targeted for a given use case.

For example, given an HTTP form data endpoint, a malicious client could supply values for
properties that exist in the model object graph but are not part of the HTML form
presented in the browser. This could lead to data being set on the model object and any
of its nested objects, that is not expected to be updated.

The recommended approach is to use a _dedicated model object_ that exposes only
properties that are relevant for the form submission. For example, on a form for changing
a user's email address, the model object should declare a minimum set of properties such
as in the following `ChangeEmailForm`.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class ChangeEmailForm {

		private String oldEmailAddress;
		private String newEmailAddress;

		public void setOldEmailAddress(String oldEmailAddress) {
			this.oldEmailAddress = oldEmailAddress;
		}

		public String getOldEmailAddress() {
			return this.oldEmailAddress;
		}

		public void setNewEmailAddress(String newEmailAddress) {
			this.newEmailAddress = newEmailAddress;
		}

		public String getNewEmailAddress() {
			return this.newEmailAddress;
		}

	}
----

If you cannot or do not want to use a _dedicated model object_ for each data
binding use case, you **must** limit the properties that are allowed for data binding.
Ideally, you can achieve this by registering _allowed field patterns_ via the
`setAllowedFields()` method on `WebDataBinder`.

For example, to register allowed field patterns in your application, you can implement an
`@InitBinder` method in a `@Controller` or `@ControllerAdvice` component as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class ChangeEmailController {

		@InitBinder
		void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
			binder.setAllowedFields("oldEmailAddress", "newEmailAddress");
		}

		// @RequestMapping methods, etc.

	}
----

In addition to registering allowed patterns, it is also possible to register _disallowed
field patterns_ via the `setDisallowedFields()` method in `DataBinder` and its subclasses.
Please note, however, that an "allow list" is safer than a "deny list". Consequently,
`setAllowedFields()` should be favored over `setDisallowedFields()`.

Note that matching against allowed field patterns is case-sensitive; whereas, matching
against disallowed field patterns is case-insensitive. In addition, a field matching a
disallowed pattern will not be accepted even if it also happens to match a pattern in the
allowed list.

[WARNING]
====
It is extremely important to properly configure allowed and disallowed field patterns
when exposing your domain model directly for data binding purposes. Otherwise, it is a
big security risk.

Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that you do **not** use types from your domain
model such as JPA or Hibernate entities as the model object in data binding scenarios.
