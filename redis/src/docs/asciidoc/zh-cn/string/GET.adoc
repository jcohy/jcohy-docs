**语法**

[source,shell]
----
DEL key [key ...]
----

**可用版本**：1.0.0

**时间复杂度**：O(N) where N is the number of keys that will be removed. When a key to remove holds a value other than a string, the individual complexity for this key is O(M) where M is the number of elements in the list, set, sorted set or hash. Removing a single key that holds a string value is O(1).

**ACL 类别**：**@keyspace, @write, @slow**

Removes the specified keys. A key is ignored if it does not exist.
