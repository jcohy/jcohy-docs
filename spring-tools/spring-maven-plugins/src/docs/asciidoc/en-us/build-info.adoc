[[build-info]]
= Integrating with Actuator
Spring Boot Actuator displays build-related information if a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is present.
The `build-info` goal generates such file with the coordinates of the project and the build time.
It also allows you to add an arbitrary number of additional properties, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",tabsize=4]
----
include::../maven/build-info/pom.xml[tags=build-info]
----

This configuration will generate a `build-info.properties` at the expected location with four additional keys.

NOTE: `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` are expected to be regular properties available in the project.
They will be interpolated as you would expect.
